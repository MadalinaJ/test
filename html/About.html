        Hello world! <br><br>
Although I had the good fortune of being born in the 1980s, a time when computer
technology hit the streets and everyone was talking about Apple, I was born just
east of the Iron Curtain where apples only grew on trees. There, each of us unfortunate
future comrades were programmed, not without the fear of God, to always wonder what Big
Brother would think of us should we wonder too far from the herd. <br><br>
After a revolution that was everything but revolutionary, the spirit of the herd continued
 forward toward a new and uneventful millennium.  And I, bent by strong opinions, went to
 law school. There, I got a degree in public administration. I know. I know! It was not
  very exciting, nor was it at all fascinating. It was exactly what was expected of me.
  And for that matter, it was exactly what I was taught to expect of myself. The spirit of
  the times dictated, as it did across the world, that artists everywhere were always and
  definitely… starving. And I, surely, needed to secure my next meal ticket if I wanted to
   get anywhere in the world. I was raised, as many people are, in the spirit of fear until
    I was not! I made a decision. I choose to break free of those chains and to literally
    move on and move forward, westward! I left my country and the shadows that still haunt
     its mentality. And, voila! Here I am. <br><br>

Along the way, I have always had one constant guiding love of drawing. The passion for
illustration that I discovered as a child became my joy through adolescence and, later
in life, my window to curiosity. It taught me the significance of exploration. Ultimately,
 it led me to the digital canvas. And here, I was recently most impressed! A natural
 evolution of things, and a little bit of luck, led me to, yet, a newer place and, yet,
  a newer language. I found a wide world without boundary that could be crafted by my own
  imagination. I wanted to learn! <br><br>


At first I was afraid and, like that catchy song, I was petrified! Looking underneath the
folds, I was confronted by a new technical world that had logic far different from the
several human languages that I had learned along the way. It seemed complex and complicated
 and it was complex and complicated! And as others before me had thought of people like me,
  I almost believed I could never grasp its method.<br><br>

But, I fell in love! The moment I saw my very first “hello world” glowing on the screen in
an html file, I found my voice. I was hooked! I began to play with the html file. I added
a few pictures, changed a few fonts in css and discovered that I could draw in a very new
 way. Boom! This wow moment of realization fueled my drive to learn computer language. It
 opened a new chapter in my life where I could explore my curiosity without limitation.<br><br>

The thrill of seeing my work come to life in front of the whole world in seconds is
electrifying. It is the feeling I get from a book I cannot put down for days. It is
the captivation I feel from a song I cannot stop listening to for hours. It is the passion
 of creativity that I discovered as a child and have now rediscovered in a whole new form.
  It is the craft that elevates each of us into a different world of endless possibility.
  And here, in the script, I found a place to share my own personality with the world.<br><br>

Now, I timidly work at the code daily in order to learn and learn in order to create. I encounter problems that take hours to fix
always hoping for ever growing skill. I sit transfixed at my keyboard thinking of nothing else but the solution, the elusive solution,
 which is hidden within the millions and billions of bits of information that often feel like the very folds of human history! 
  And each time I find that little bit of code that fixes the problem; I encounter my very own moment of revelation. Aha! Eureka.
  I am a fixer of problems within this universe. I am chosen.
Praise the gods of the internet! I smile. The thrill of the challenge drives me forward
 wanting to learn more and to do more.<br><br>

I now feel like a child that will fight the algorithm dragons within
mountains of complexity. I push forward into a never ending story of trial and error
 leaving far behind the eyes and opinions of others! It is never too late to change
 your path. It is never too late to break the chains of limitation. I look forward to
 making my mark on the blank canvas of a truly brave new world shaped by a liberated
 human possibility.<br>
